## Prompt
Using the following GeoJSON layers: ([kc-neighborhoods.json](kc-neighborhoods.json), [kc-tracts.json](kc-tracts.json)), create a webpage to fetch the raw files and appropriately visualize them together on a map, along with an interactive chart of their commuter population attributes. We use [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) and [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) for our map and chart visualizations, but feel free to use any libraries or APIs that you prefer. Do your best, within reason, to make the layout and design of the experience device responsive and WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.

## Notes
This repository is a work in progress! Credit goes to:

-Dallas Bille's "Intro to React Mapbox GL JS" 
- @urbica/react-map-gl documentation
-Mapbox documentation
-Leigh Halliday's "Interactive Maps in React"

and many more for their excellent resources. I am still working on implementing to the prompt here.
